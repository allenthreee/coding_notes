## 6.7 CHECKLIST: Class Quality

### 6.7.1 Abstract Data Types

#### 6.7.1.1 have you thought of the classes in your program as abstract data types and evaluate their interfaces from that point of view?

### 6.7.2 Abstraction

#### 6.7.2.1 Dose the class have a central purpose?

#### 6.7.2.2 Is the class well-named, and dose its name describe its central purpose?

#### 6.7.2.3 Dose the class's interface present a consistent abstraction?

#### 6.7.2.4 Is the class's interface make obvious that you don't have to think how its services are implemented? Can you treat the class as a black box?

#### 6.7.2.5 Are the class's service complete enough that other classes don't have to meddle  with its internal data?

#### 6.7.2.6 Has unrelated information been moved out of the class?

#### 6.7.2.7 Have thought about subdividing the class into component classes, and have you subdivided it as much as you can?

#### 6.7.2.8 Are you preserving the integrity of the class's interface as you modify the class?

### 6.7.3 Encapsulation

#### 6.7.3.1
